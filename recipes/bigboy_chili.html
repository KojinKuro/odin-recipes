        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <h3>FOR THE CHILI</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pot over medium high heat and add in your beef, 
                allowing the fat to render out and the meat to brown. Season 
                lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>While the beef is cooking, wash and cut all of your vegetables. 
                Cut the potatoes into a large dice, onion into a small dice, the 
                poblano into a medium dice, the green onions into small slices 
                and the jalapeño into thin slices.</li>
            <li>When the beef is about 90% of the way cooked, move it to the 
                perimeter of the pot and allow the fat to pool in the center. 
                Dump the chili powder, paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper into 
                the oil and allow the spices to bloom for 30 seconds or so.</li>
            <li>Mix the spices into the beef and add in the onions and peppers. 
                Allow those to cook for 1 to 2 minutes then add in the garlic, 
                potatoes, and rice. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add in the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, broth, and beans. Bring 
                to a light boil, reduce the heat to medium low and cover. Simmer 
                for 20-30 minutes or until the potatoes have softened and rice 
                has cooked.</li>
            <li>This is a thick chili. If you want a soupier consistency, add 
                more broth or water.</li>    
        </ol>

        <h3>FOR THE CORNBREAD</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>While the chili is stewing, start the cornbread.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl mix together the dry ingredients until combined 
                and no clumps remain.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, crack an egg and beat it.</li>
            <li>Add in the sugar, milk, and oil. Mix until the oil has combined 
                with the other ingredients and the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Combine the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir 
                until smooth.</li>
            <li>Spray 5 wells of a muffin tin with oil and divide the batter 
                evenly 5 ways. You can also cook this in a cake pan, it may 
                affect the time though.</li>
            <li>Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 15 minutes or until the tops just start to brown.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>FOR THE CHILI</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>After the chili has been stewing for 20-30 minutes, remove the 
                lid and test the rice and potatoes for doneness. Season with salt 
                and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>PLATING</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>This recipe makes 5 servings. Divide the contents of the pot 
                evenly between 5 meal prep containers. Divide ½ cup (56)g of cheese 
                between the containers. Also top them with 1 tbsp or 14g of sour cream. 
                Each dish gets a sprinkling of green onions and a few jalapeño slices.</li>
            <li>To store the cornbread, I just wrap it in foil and place it on the counter.</li>
        </ol>
