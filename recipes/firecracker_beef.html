        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <h3>FOR THE RICE</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make enough rice to yield 3¾ cups of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry 
                rice will make between 2-3 cups of cooked rice depending on what 
                type of rice you use.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>FOR THE BEEF & BRUSSELS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and cut all of your vegetables first.</li>
            <li>Cut the stems off of your Brussels sprouts and remove any of the
                 damaged outer layers. Cut them in half.</li>
            <li>Cut the onion, green onions, and peppers into a small dice. 
                Mince your garlic if you're using fresh.</li>
            <li>Place the Brussels sprout halves into a large bowl and drizzle 
                over ½ tbsp of oil. Season with salt and pepper to your liking.</li>
            <li>Preheat your air fryer to 400°F.</li>
            <li>Place the Brussels sprouts into the air fryer basket and air fry 
                for 5-8 minutes or until they have browned and softened. Watch 
                them closely so they don't burn. If you don't have an air fryer 
                you could cook them in the oven.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium high heat, add ½ tbsp of oil and 
                add the onions, peppers, and 1 of red pepper flakes. Cook for 3-5 
                minutes to brown and soften. Add in the garlic.</li>
            <li>Move the onions and peppers to the perimeter of the skillet and 
                add in your beef. Season with salt and pepper. Allow the beef 
                to brown.</li>
            <li>When the beef is cooking, prepare your sauce. Mix the honey, hot 
                sauce, vinegar, and cornstarch together. Stir well to incorporate 
                the cornstarch so it doesn't clump up.</li>
            <li>When the beef is about 90% of the way cooked, add in the Brussels 
                sprouts, pour in the sauce and mix into the beef allowing it to 
                thicken. Stir to combine. If you feel that your sauce is too thick, 
                you can drizzle in some water to thin it out.</li>
        </ol>
                
        <h3>PLATING</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>This recipe makes 5 servings. Divide your ingredients evenly into 
                your 5 containers. Each dish gets ¾ (112g) cup of cooked rice.</li>
            <li>Top each dish with green onions and a lime wedge if you wish. I 
                like to squeeze lime juice over the dish after reheating.</li>
        </ol>
