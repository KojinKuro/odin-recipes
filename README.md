# odin-recipes
Online Cookbook Recipe Site

## 📝 Description

This is a website built around impleting basic HTML for an online recipe website. It was later updated with CSS for styling. This was my first time using HTML in a while and was good practice getting back into web development. I did not have much challenge implementing this basic website. Given that I have much more experience now, it would be good if I improved this site by adding Javascript and expanding it into a full website. This was my first time using Github Pages and is something I will continue to use for my future projects.

## 🌱 Context

The focus of this project was around practicing HTML. This project took around 3 hours to complete.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- Add more recipes
- Do more styling for the website to make it more aesthetically pleasing
- Add a search bar to search for recipes
- Add a back end database to store the recipes. The site will be able to call this database and show the recipes.
